🎬 Movie Recommendation System
A content-based movie recommender system developed by Kartik Kapri. This machine learning project recommends movies to users based on movie metadata such as genre, actors, and director using cosine similarity.

📌 Overview
This project utilizes content-based filtering to recommend similar movies. Given a movie input, the system finds and ranks other movies that share similar features (like genre, cast, and direction). The underlying method used to compare content is cosine similarity, a popular technique in information retrieval.

⚙️ Technologies & Libraries Used
-> Python
-> Pandas – for data manipulation
-> Scikit-learn – for machine learning operations and cosine similarity
-> Numpy – for numerical computations.

🧠 Machine Learning Concepts
-> Content-Based Filtering: Uses item features to recommend other items similar to what the user likes.
-> Cosine Similarity: A metric used to measure how similar two documents (in this case, movies) are irrespective of their size.

Enter a movie name: Inception
